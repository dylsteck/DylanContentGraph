Happy Saturday and welcome back to Next in Tech! We have another jam-packed newsletter covering the latest in crypto regulation, a leadership change at YouTube, and newly highlighted limitations on large language models. Let's dive in:

## Update on Crypto Regulation

It's already been a busy 2023 for crypto regulation, but it feel as though this week was especially crazy. 

On Thursday the Securities and Exchange Commission formally charges Terraform of fraud. In his statement, SEC chair Gary Gensler said "Terraform and Kwon repeatedly misled and deceived investors that a popular Korean mobile payment application used the Terra blockchain to settle transactions that would accrue value to LUNA"([source](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-32#:~:text=%22We%20allege%20that%20Terraform%20and,said%20SEC%20Chair%20Gary%20Gensler.)), among other claims surrounding LUNA and TerraUSD. And on Friday, the SEC [charged](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-34) former NBA Hall of Famer Paul Pierce for touting the coin EthereumMax, for which he will pay a $1.4M settlement. He was charged on the same count, and for promoting the same coin, [as Kim Kardashian](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) was in October. 

This year several US regulatory bodies have been swift to enact in crypto following the FTX downfall late last year, but many in the crypto industry are looking for more legislative framework that can be applied. In his [guest post for Pirate Wires](https://www.piratewires.com/p/crypto-choke-point), Castle Island Ventures' Founding Partner [Nic Carter](https://twitter.com/nic__carter) explained that he believes the moves being made across the government are a "coordinated plan" to crackdown on crypto and to limit access to traditional banking. 

## Blur vs. OpenSea

Things are quickly heating up in the NFT market space, and Blur is making waves. The popular platform has gained significant traction over the past few months and on Tuesday they [launched their $BLUR token airdrop](https://www.coinspeaker.com/nft-blur-token-airdrop/), dropping 85% of the token's suply. And [according to DappRadar](https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces), Blur has the highest 30 day volume of any NFT marketplace at $514M, with OpenSea right behind them at $440M. 

In response to Blur's popularity, [OpenSea announced](https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1626682043655507969) a 0% platform fee and that they are moving to optional creator fees(0.5% min). In their thread, the OpenSea team elaborated that these decisions were in part due to the rise of and recent changes at Blur: "Recent events – including Blur’s decision to roll back creator earnings (even on filtered collections) and the false choice they’re forcing creators to make between liquidity on Blur or OpenSea – prove that our attempts are not working".
