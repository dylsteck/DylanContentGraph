Happy Saturday and welcome back to Next in Tech! We have another jam-packed newsletter covering the latest in crypto regulation, a leadership change at YouTube, and newly highlighted limitations on large language models. Let's dive in:

## Update on Crypto Regulation

It's already been a busy 2023 for crypto regulation, but it feel as though this week was especially crazy. 

On Thursday the Securities and Exchange Commission formally charges Terraform of fraud. In his statement, SEC chair Gary Gensler said "Terraform and Kwon repeatedly misled and deceived investors that a popular Korean mobile payment application used the Terra blockchain to settle transactions that would accrue value to LUNA"([source](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-32#:~:text=%22We%20allege%20that%20Terraform%20and,said%20SEC%20Chair%20Gary%20Gensler.)), among other claims surrounding LUNA and TerraUSD. And on Friday, the SEC [charged](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-34) former NBA Hall of Famer Paul Pierce for touting the coin EthereumMax, for which he will pay a $1.4M settlement. He was charged on the same count, and for promoting the same coin, [as Kim Kardashian](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) was in October. 

This year several US regulatory bodies have been swift to enact in crypto following the FTX downfall late last year, but many in the crypto industry are looking for more legislative framework that can be applied. In his [guest post for Pirate Wires](https://www.piratewires.com/p/crypto-choke-point), Castle Island Ventures' Founding Partner [Nic Carter](https://twitter.com/nic__carter) explained that he believes the moves being made across the government are a "coordinated plan" to crackdown on crypto and to limit access to traditional banking. 

## Blur vs. OpenSea
Things are quickl
Blur, a hot NFT marketplace, launched their airdrop earlier this week. They have been using sociakl media influence and other tactics to adopt users, and have taken enough market share to get OpenSea panicking. In response, OpenSea is offering 0% royalties for a limited time.
