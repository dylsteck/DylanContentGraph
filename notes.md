-   ishika also got into crypto during sophomore in quarantine, is a senior now
    -   was working with hyperspace two years ago, but fully web2 saas, was first job
    -   left hyperspace to go into web3, joined mem and was with matt and brian
        -   protocol for web3 deso
    -   focusing on identity & reputation cross chain
    -   all left mem around reorg, beginning of last year
    -   she went to hulu, completely diff
        -   corporate and media
        -   disney streaming and hulu, product side
    -   came back to start senior year, was hopping on diff projects(contract work)
        -   strategy, BD, etc for startups
    -   recently helping cross boarder payment protocol called purple pay
        -   regulatory compliance paymenet protocl on polygon
    -   also gonna help w hyperspace
    -   wallets
    -   what building w sealvault what supposed to do with mem
        -   similar thought process
    -   lot of wallet stuff might not be ideal to build
    -   was thinking about email aliases for wallets
        -   then learned about AA, got into that
        -   chatting back and forth around these things
    -   we all have many wallets, hard to keep track
        -   within wallets have accounts too, etc
    -   jotting stuff down
        -   zerion v rainbow v metamask
    -   what's a wallet visualizer vs a functional wallet
        -   zerion more visualizer and manager, not using to do stuff
        -   connect mm to most dapps
        -   diff usage
-   wallets
    -   lots of product frameworks re alex
        -   agree that lot of info, but what's the next step
        -   better on text back and forth
    -   obvious wallet looking at to possibly join
    -   asked if question is build something new like sealvault or iterate on rainbow
        -   use what's already existing, import in new wallet framework(import into a manager that will prompt to make new alias)
        -   dont make it more confusing
        -   after get to use notion you know habits, dont want em to manage all these accounts, they manage it for you
        -   use wallet connect and this is the one place
        -   half time not categorizing interactions, just using random wallets, most easy to come across, forget which one
        -   hard to stay secure and organized
-   farcaster identity
    -   lot of potential, but not optimized for identity usage more for apps
    -   more focus on apps than indvl identity
    -   what can you do with your fc address?
    -   if have something like chainstory inputted into farcaster account, can enable lot of interesting apps that can be built on fc
        -   how can use same reputation on a diff app?
    -   identity at the moment is only what's on warpcast
        -   solely what you've been doing there
        -   not very robust
    -   identity separate from an app
        -   would need to use Cast object or build your own db
        -   anyone has to build identity up using warpcast
        -   someone web3 native recently joins fc, their identity is zero to none
    -   what mem was trying to do is import existing credentials at one spot, start at base layer from web2
    -   orbis focuses on social, but fc could've others
    -   all web3 social trying to build infra to start making the same apps of web2 on a decentralized network
        -   cant be same exact thing as web2, need something different
    -   you have that protocol layer, then sdk on top of it, will enable desoc
        -   then have sdk, tools to build apps
    -   lots building similar things/infra, but no focus on how you scale that -- take identity from web2
        -   reputational identity big part of it
    -   gum on solana same thing
    -   product driving protocol, but lens opposite
    -   would be sick if can come to my profile and see what i've collected
    -   yash building web3 world and looking for incentivation
        -   thinks personally not about collecting a post
        -   like why do you
    -   [https://yup.io](https://yup.io/) would be cool if expanded to other sites
    -   if able to integrate stuff in your profile, like nfts, can do other stuff
    -   fc app store
        -   protocols with apps will become an os
        -   but at the same time, alex was saying, some people building protocols are a bit selfish, protocols don't talk to each other
        -   separate problems doing similar things not talking, makes it hard for users
-   keep chatting, will tell alex we chatted
