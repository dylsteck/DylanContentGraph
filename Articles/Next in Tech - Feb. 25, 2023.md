## Coinbase launches Base L2

Have you been wondering what all the blue dots on crypto Twitter were about? The wait is finally over, as we now know it was marketing for the release of Coinbase’s new L2 called [Base](https://base.org). Base is built to scale large dapps, which makes sense since L2s are built for lower fees and security, and can support games, NFTs, DEXs, and more. The L2 is built on Optimism’s [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/) and is currently available as a testnet.

When [describing their motivations and goals for building Base](https://base.mirror.xyz/jjQnUq_UNTQOk7psnGBFOsShi7FlrRp8xevQUipG_Gk), the Coinbase Team outlined how crucial they think it is for the growth of web3 to build a platform that could support useful dapps and the next billion users web3. Coinbase also noted that their own stack was built mostly on web2 technologies before they began building Base, which fed into their motivation as well as pushed them to build something that could be used both internally and by developers who want to build with Coinbase-grade security.

So, what’s the future of Base and how does Coinbase envision the future of L2s?
