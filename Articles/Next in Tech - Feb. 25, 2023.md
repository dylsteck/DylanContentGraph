Happy Saturday and welcome back to Next in Tech! Let’s dive in:

## Coinbase launches Base L2

Have you been wondering what all the blue dots on crypto Twitter were about? The wait is finally over, as we now know it was marketing for the release of Coinbase’s new L2 called [Base](https://base.org). Base is built to scale large dapps, which makes sense since L2s are built for lower fees and security, and can support games, NFTs, DEXs, and more. The L2 is built on Optimism’s [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/) and is currently available as a testnet.

When [describing their motivations and goals for building Base](https://base.mirror.xyz/jjQnUq_UNTQOk7psnGBFOsShi7FlrRp8xevQUipG_Gk), the Coinbase Team outlined how crucial they think it is for the growth of web3 to build a platform that could support useful dapps and the next billion users web3. Coinbase also noted that their own stack was built mostly on web2 technologies before they began building Base, which fed into their motivation as well as pushed them to build something that could be used both internally and by developers who want to build with Coinbase-grade security.

So, what’s the future of Base and how does Coinbase envision the future of L2s? Coinbase has contributed to ecosystem infrastructure such as [EIP4844](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/supporting-eip-4844-reducing-fees-for-ethereum-layer-2-rollups), which helps reduce fees for L2 rollups. They want Base to be interoperable with other chains as opposed to an “island”, and the Coinbase team envisions a superchain forming that makes it easier to “jointly scale Ethereum”. Coinbase also announced their [Base Ecosystem Fund](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeiSAod4PAbXlvvDGtHWu-GqzGpvHYfaTQR2f77AawD7GYc4Q/viewform) to support teams developing on Base.

## Spotify AI + NFTs

In the lead up to their [Stream On](https://newsroom.spotify.com/stream-on/) event on March 8th, Spotify has announced two key features that have the online community buzzing: an AI-powered DJ and new NFT-based features.

Spotify DJ is an OpenAI-powered service that will curate a live tracklist whenver it's activated. The tool also has a voice-based AI that narrates the set based upon relevant tracks and artists, similar to a DJ on the radio. The tool is much nededed for Spotify and removes friction in finding tracks to listen to.

## DOJ to Unveil Antitrust Suit Blocking Adobe’s Figma Acquisition

According to [a report from Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-23/doj-preparing-suit-to-block-adobe-s-20-billion-deal-for-figma?leadSource=uverify%20wall), The Department of Justice is planning to unveil an antitrust suit in the next few weeks that will block Adobe's acquisition of the web-based design platform Figma. Big tech antitrust suits seem to be a large theme of the past few months, but this one is certainly a big unexpected, as Adobe isn't necessarily one of the first big tech companies to come to mind(when compared to the likes of Google, Meta, TikTok etc). The acquisition, announced in the summer of 2022, did cause quite the stir within the tech community. It also led to an open-sourced competitor of Figma raising a sizable round and gaining adoption quickly.
