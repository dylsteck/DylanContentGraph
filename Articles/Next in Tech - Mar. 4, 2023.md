Happy Saturday and welcome back to Next in Tech! Hope everyone had a great week. We're back this week with a banger after a hiaitus last week. 

## Coinbase launches Base L2

Have you been wondering what all the blue dots on crypto Twitter were about? The wait is finally over, as we now know it was marketing for the release of Coinbase’s new L2 called [Base](https://base.org). Base is built to scale large dapps, which makes sense since L2s are built for lower fees and security, and can support games, NFTs, DEXs, and more. Base's launch was so popular that their [Base, Introduced NFT collection](https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1629981232732749830) has been minted over 350K times and(as of 2/26/23) is the number one gas burner of the last 24 hours. The L2 is built on Optimism’s [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/) and is currently available as a testnet.

When [describing their motivations and goals for building Base](https://base.mirror.xyz/jjQnUq_UNTQOk7psnGBFOsShi7FlrRp8xevQUipG_Gk), the Coinbase Team outlined how crucial they think it is for the growth of web3 to build a platform that could support useful dapps and the next billion users web3. Coinbase also noted that their own stack was built mostly on web2 technologies before they began building Base, which fed into their motivation as well as pushed them to build something that could be used both internally and by developers who want to build with Coinbase-grade security.

So, what’s the future of Base and how does Coinbase envision the future of L2s? Coinbase has contributed to ecosystem infrastructure such as [EIP4844](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/supporting-eip-4844-reducing-fees-for-ethereum-layer-2-rollups), which helps reduce fees for L2 rollups. They want Base to be interoperable with other chains as opposed to an “island”, and the Coinbase team envisions a superchain forming that makes it easier to “jointly scale Ethereum”. Coinbase also announced their [Base Ecosystem Fund](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeiSAod4PAbXlvvDGtHWu-GqzGpvHYfaTQR2f77AawD7GYc4Q/viewform) to support teams developing on Base.


## Spotify AI + NFTs

In the lead up to their [Stream On](https://newsroom.spotify.com/stream-on/) event on March 8th, Spotify has announced two key features that have the online community buzzing: an AI-powered DJ and new NFT-based features.

Spotify DJ is an OpenAI-powered service that will curate a live tracklist whenver it's activated. The tool also has a voice-based AI that narrates the set based upon relevant tracks and artists, similar to a DJ on the radio. The tool is much nededed for Spotify and removes friction in finding tracks to listen to.

## On My Mind: Internet as a Data Source

![Screenshot essay on a standard for web content](Media/StandardForWebContentSSEssay.png)

I shared this screenshot essay on Farcaster a few days ago -- the topic has been on my mind. As some readers might know, I've been working on a browser called [Cortex](https://withcortex.com) for a while now. A core idea for Cortex is that users should be able to shape their data however they want -- the browser should get the data & the user can render it however they want, whether that's combining data from other sources, running whatever commands they want, or styling data differently. 

In order to shape data that way, you need to think about how data is retrieved and rendered on the web. How do you structure web data and how do you find what actions and schema can be operated on? There are two main methods that I outline in the screenshot essay:
- Building a library of app connectors, maintained both by the team and by the community. This is similar to what Zapier does, except it would require much more granularity to retrieve every piece of data and every action from the site. And what happens if an app updates -- how is the app's subsequent library updated?
- Building an agent that can control the browser in realtime to perform the necessary operations. There have been many examples of this, from smallers examples like Nat Friedman's Natbot to fully-funded teams like Adpet AI's Act-I.
