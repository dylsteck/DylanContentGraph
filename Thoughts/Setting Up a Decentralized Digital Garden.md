I finally did something that was long overdue: setting up my digital garden. I've always wanted to have one website that contained everything I did online -- from social media to articles to coding repositories -- all in one place. More importantly, I wanted to build a digital garden that I could not only share with others as a way to externalize my thoughts, but that I can also self refer to as I continue building projects and researching. 

Before I talk a bit about how I set this site up and why I think its architecture is important to highlight, I want to give some context on what a digital garden is.
