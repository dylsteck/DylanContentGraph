Welcome back to Next in Tech, I hope everyone had a great week!

Before we dive into this wild week, I wanted to quickly highlight [my digital garden](https://dylansteck.com) that I [just covered yesterday](https://dylsteck.substack.com/p/building-a-digital-garden). It has all of my articles, tweets, and casts from Farcaster. I’m happy it’s finally out and have really appreciated everyone’s comments. Without further ado, let’s dive in!

## SEC Has its Eyes Set on Staking

On Thursday, news broke that the SEC was [shutting down Kraken’s staking program in a $30M settlement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-09/crypto-exchange-kraken-ends-staking-program-in-sec-settlement). In their [press release](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-25), the SEC alleged that Kraken had been “failing to register the offer and sale of their crypto asset staking-as-a-service program”. Just a day beforehand, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong [tweeted a warning](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1623459203150131201) that the SEC wanted to get rid of staking for American retail investors.

For reference, staking is the act of locking up 32 ETH to help in the blockchain’s [validation process](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/#validators), which will then give those who stake rewards for participating in the validation process. It is something that can be done at larger scales(locking 32 ETH) or at smaller scales(retail investors staking smaller amounts to earn rewards).

This decision by the SEC has been highly criticized by many, especially in the crypto community. In a statement on Thursday, Blockchain Association CEO Kristen Smith [said](https://theblockchainassociation.org/blockchain-association-reacts-to-todays-settlement-between-the-sec-and-kraken/) the SEC “continues its attack on U.S. crypto companies and retail investors, regulating by enforcement and undercutting the potential of public blockchain networks in the United States”. In addition, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce [shared an article](https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-statement-kraken-020923) expressing her dissent for the crackdown on Kraken.

## Bing is Back

The AI battle has truly begun. Fresh off of announcing GPT integrations in the Office Suite, Microsoft [launched](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/07/reinventing-search-with-a-new-ai-powered-microsoft-bing-and-edge-your-copilot-for-the-web/) their new age, AI-powered Bing and Edge. Bing now offers a chatbot within their search, with up-to-date information and even citations. In addition, Edge now has a right-side panel to use the chatbot or compose content, such as writing an email. This is a long anticipated launch that brings Bing back into the conversation — so much so that it has risen to #14 in the App Store.
