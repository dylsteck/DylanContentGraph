*This is in part a response to the recent PurpleDAO prop ["What should Purple spend its time and ETH doing"](https://prop.house/purple/what-should-purple-spend-its-time-and-eth-doing)*

The activity on Farcaster is making it apparent that community members want to see changes to PurpleDAO. Personally speaking I saw Purple needing to address a few things anyways, but the increased activity over the past few weeks has seemed to have escalated this need for change even further.

I'm going to address two main areas I think Purple should think about change -- goals and governance -- and then talk about what I want to see Purple be.

First, I think Purple should have a central goal, or if not a central goal some list or statement to capture what Purple should be. When I first saw Purple forming I assumed the goal was to help Farcaster however it could, and while that assumption hasn't faded away for me, I feel like a stronger purpose can help keep members on the same page about what it is they're doing in the DAO.

Second, I think the following changes should be made to governance: off-chain/L2 voting, communication all on one platform, and a set schedule of community calls. These changes will help make sure more members vote, discourse is easier to keep track of, and members can have set times to frequently review what the DAO is and should be doing. In addition, while I know nouns.build now lets you delegate your votes, these changes to governance could promote higher engagement and less delegation.

I joined Purple because I want to be part of a DAO that actively want to support the protocol. I've spent a lot of time over the past year on Farcaster and have really enjoyed building on the protocol, having conversations, and most importantly building connections and friendships. The power of the community is something that I think is very strong, and so I want to make sure the best things are done to grow and maintain it long-term.

Purple is in a very advantageous position right now and will be even more so if the ship is steered in the right direction. Not only can the DAO be a place for Farcaster users to strategize the most impactful props or changes for the community, but it can also be an leading example for how to push forward on-chain governance.

I hope Purple can reach new heights and that the efforts of the DAO can help best expand Farcaster, as well as push the boundaries for how groups coordinate. ðŸŸª ðŸ«¡
